# PageRank
  We aimed to show how PageRank Algorithm, which is the basis for how Google as a search engine work and how it evolved, with deep dive into mathematical equations and Advanced algorithms
  , and how it relates to linear Algebraic concepts like Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors. 
  This was part of the Research project made for the course of Linear Algebra in the University.
